Project Decription:
     #Website designed to provide a unique environment for teams that work in a cloud environment.

The purpose of this is to: 
        #1 bridge the communication gap between teams
        #2 provide a landing page for teams that they can update as needed.

   #1: Figma design layout
   #2: Templating for the pages (Component selection  --> Use MUI)
